  </strong>
    <h4>
        <br>
        Once upon a time in the bustling town of Kottakal, there was a school known for its love of knowledge and its diverse group of students. This school was nestled in a valley, surrounded by towering mountains, which, as legends had it, held the key to understanding the shape of the Earth.
<br>
<br>
In this school, a curious group of students, including Raihan, Hamda, minhaj, and Hina, were known for their insatiable thirst for knowledge. One sunny afternoon, their history teacher, Ummu salma miss, shared tales of ancient philosophers and explorers who had pondered the Earth's shape.
<br>
<br>
First on the list was Thales, an ancient Greek philosopher. Thales believed that the Earth was flat and floated on water like a gigantic wooden disc. This idea fascinated the students, but they wondered how one could prove such a theory.
<br>
<br>
Next, they learned about Pythagoras, a brilliant mathematician. Pythagoras speculated that the Earth was a sphere, an idea that intrigued Liam, who loved geometry. He imagined the Earth as a perfect sphere, just like the ones he drew in his math class.
<br>
<br>
Aristotle, a wise philosopher, believed the Earth was a sphere, too. His observations of lunar eclipses and the curved shadow they cast on the moon provided strong evidence.Hamda, who adored stargazing, was captivated by Aristotle's thoughts and wondered how the sky looked from the other side of the world.
<br>
<br>
Aryabhata, a brilliant Indian mathematician and astronomer, calculated the Earth's circumference with astounding accuracy. Hina, fascinated by ancient Indian knowledge, marveled at Aryabhata's insights, realizing that knowledge transcends borders.
<br>
<br>
As the students delved deeper into history, they learned about Magellan, the great explorer, who embarked on a daring voyage around the world. His circumnavigation proved that the Earth was indeed a sphere, leaving the students in awe of his courageous spirit.
<br>
<br>
Copernicus, the revolutionary astronomer, introduced the heliocentric model, shifting the perspective of the cosmos. Raihan, with a passion for the stars, was inspired by Copernicus's revolutionary ideas.
<br>
<br>
Finally, they encountered Isaac Newton, the genius physicist who described gravity's influence on the planets. This revelation cemented the understanding of the Earth's spherical shape.
<br>
<br>
Inspired by these historical figures, the students decided to embark on their own adventure. They would climb the nearby mountains, where, as legends said, one could glimpse the curvature of the Earth. Armed with compasses, maps, and their insatiable curiosity, they set out on their quest.
<br>
<br>
As they ascended, the horizon began to expand, revealing a breathtaking panoramic view. At the peak, they stood in awe, gazing at the world spread out before themâ€”a sight that confirmed, beyond doubt, the spherical nature of the Earth.
<br>
<br>
The students returned to their school with a newfound appreciation for the journey from beliefs to reality. They realized that knowledge, like the Earth, is vast and ever-expanding, waiting to be explored by curious minds. And so, their love for learning continued, fueled by the stories of those who dared to question and explore the mysteries of the world.
